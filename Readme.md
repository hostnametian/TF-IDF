#### TF-IDF vectorization and the analysis of different text similarity metrics

1.TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) is a common weighting technique used in information retrieval and text mining. An easy to understand application scenario is when we have some articles on hand and we want the computer to do keyword extraction automatically. TF-IDF is a statistical method that can help us to accomplish this task. It can be used to evaluate the importance of a word for one of the documents in a collection or a corpus.

2.Code implementations of cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Jaccard similarity and vector inner product to find out which one is more suitable for our task.
